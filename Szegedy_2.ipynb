    "\n",
    "A standard way to achieve both is to define $P$ via a Metropolis–Hastings proposal-and-accept mechanism: first propose a candidate move using a simple sparse kernel $T$, then accept/reject it using an acceptance rule $A$ chosen to enforce detailed balance.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, “flip a single spin” corresponds to $N=n$ moves: $z^{(i)}\\in\\{\\pm 1\\}^n$ with $z^{(i)}_i=-1$ and $z^{(i)}_s=+1$ for $s\\neq i$. For $n=4$ these are\n",

    "We can of course avoid this limitation by padding to the next power of two the moves and consider any move between $N$ and $2^{\\lceil \\log_2 N\\rceil}$ to be a dummy move that stays in the same state, with a slowdown factor of $2^{\\lceil \\log_2 N\\rceil}/N < 2$.

    "The composition $CX \\cdot CSX \\cdot CX$ implements a valid $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{SWAP}}$, but it does not send $|10\\rangle$ to $\\frac{|10\\rangle+|01\\rangle}{\\sqrt2}$ with equal real amplitudes. Instead (up to a global phase) it maps $\\ket{10} \\mapsto \\frac{\\ket{10} + i \\ket{01}}{\\sqrt 2} $. so the two branches have a relative phase $+\\pi/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the binary-tree construction for $V$, the excitation \"moves right\" a different number of times depending on which one-hot basis state you end up in. Each \"move right\" contributes an extra factor of $i$, so without correction you will not get all the phases equal. Probabilities are still uniform, but phases differ, which can break later. The \"phase fix\" is applying an $S$ gate ($S=\\mathrm{diag}(1,i)$) on the right wire after each $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{SWAP}}$ in the tree. That cancels the $i$ phase picked up when the excitation goes to the right child."
