One approach is to compute the stationary distribution $\\pi$ numerically (via power iteration) and then verify the detailed balance equations directly. However, this approach has downsides: convergence may be slow for nearly reducible chains, and small numerical errors in $\\pi$ are amplified when multiplied by transition probabilities.\n",

    "## Representing $P$ in Szegedy's format\n",
    "\n",
    "Szegedy's construction does not act directly on the transition matrix $P$ as a linear operator on probability vectors. We embed it into an operator $W$ acting on the enlarger Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathbb{C}^d \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^d$ to enforce the unitarity of the transformation. In this space, basis states $|x\\rangle|y\\rangle$ can be interpreted as directed edges from $x$ to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle $W$ is defined by its action on states of the form $\\ket{x}\\ket{0}$ and acts like\n",
    "$$\\ket{x}\\ket{0} \\mapsto \\ket{w_x} \\ket{x}, \\qquad |w_x\\rangle = \\sum_{y=0}^{d-1} \\sqrt{P_{x y}} \\, |y\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, the first register holds the result of $P x$ and the second register starts clean then holds the input that once was in the first register. This \"swap\" step is a convention and you can of course re-define the framework to work with transformation in the form $\\ket{x}\\ket{0} \\mapsto \\ket{x} \\ket{w_x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isometry to unitarity\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator $W$ appearing in Szegedy's construction is not defined as a unitary on the full Hilbert space. Instead, it is first specified as an *isometry*. Concretely, $W$ is defined by its action on the subspace spanned by basis states $|x\\rangle|0\\rangle$,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W:\\ |x\\rangle|0\\rangle \\longmapsto |w_x\\rangle|x\\rangle,\n",
    "\\qquad\n",
    "|w_x\\rangle = \\sum_y \\sqrt{P_{xy}}\\,|y\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This mapping preserves inner products on its domain and therefore satisfies $W^\\dagger W = I$ on that subspace. Since the output states $|w_x\\rangle|x\\rangle$ live in a larger Hilbert space, $W$ enlarges the space and is not invertible on its image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use $W$ in a quantum circuit, it must be implemented as a unitary operator acting on the full register space. This is achieved by extending the isometry to a unitary: the action of $W$ is fixed on the subspace $\\{|x\\rangle|0\\rangle\\}$, while its action on the orthogonal complement is defined so that the overall operator is unitary. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation in Qiskit\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit implements $W$ by first swapping the two $n$-qubit registers so $|x\\rangle|0\\rangle \\mapsto |0\\rangle|x\\rangle$, then looping over each row $x$ of $P$ and building an amplitude vector with entries $\\sqrt{P[x,y]}$ (zero-padded to length $2^n$ and normalized). It appends a `StatePreparation` gate for this vector, multi-controlled on the second register being $|x\\rangle$, so that only in that case the first register is prepared as $|w_x\\rangle=\\sum_y \\sqrt{P[x,y]}|y\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to avoid StatePreparation, the most direct construction is a cascade of multi-controlled $R_y$ rotations where each rotation sets a conditional probability of one output bit given the previously prepared bits."
